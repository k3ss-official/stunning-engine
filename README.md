# Stunning Engine

## Project Objective

The Stunning Engine is a custom-trained, state-of-the-art image generation and editing system, specifically designed and optimized for fashion, editorial, hair styling, and candid photography applications. This project aims to develop a powerful, locally-run image generation engine that delivers professional-quality results without relying on cloud services or external GPU resources.

What sets this project apart is its exclusive focus on Apple Silicon M4 hardware optimization. The Stunning Engine is built from the ground up to leverage the computational capabilities of Apple's M4 chips, ensuring that all components—from training pipelines to inference endpoints—are specifically tailored to run efficiently on local Apple Silicon hardware.

## M4-First Mandate

This project adheres to a strict M4-first development philosophy:

- **Local-Only Processing**: Every workflow, training pipeline, and inference endpoint is optimized exclusively for local Apple Silicon M4 hardware. No cloud computing or GPU rental services are permitted at any stage of development or deployment.

- **Hardware Optimization**: All scripts, checkpoints, and adapters are specifically designed to run efficiently on devices with 16 GB RAM or greater, utilizing the Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) framework for accelerated computation.

- **Resource Efficiency**: The entire system is engineered to deliver state-of-the-art results while operating within the memory and computational constraints of consumer-grade Apple Silicon hardware.

- **No External Dependencies**: The project maintains complete independence from cloud-based APIs, external GPU resources, or any computational services that would take processing off the local device.

## Core Project Phases

The development of the Stunning Engine encompasses the following key phases:

### 1. Research
