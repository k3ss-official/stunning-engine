  "goal": "Merge LoRA and TI adapters into the core SD3 Medium backbone. Quantize the final model (4-bit, GGUF or best M4 format) and document performance/compatibility.",
  "return_format": [
    "Final model checkpoint(s) in /tasks/T08/output/models/",
    "integration_notes.md with details on merge/quant process and compatibility"

  "warnings": [
    "Output checkpoint must run inference on M4 with <12GB RAM.",
    "Keep a copy of pre-quantized model for backup."
  ],
  "context_dump": "Final merged model is deployed for all image generation and downstream use. Quantization is critical for resource efficiency."
